# Home Assistant

Home assistant is a tool that can connect with other devices. You could have different areas you could set up a temperature monitor. You can put automations to dim the lights at a time turn them on slowly by increasing the brigtness over a period of time. You could set up scripts for home assistant so you say what is the temperature in the living room. If you had a sensor in the living room it would reply the temperature in the living room is (?) degrees (C/F). An example of another is Chris and his RV that thing holds footage of his cameras and motion sensors. Home assistant can be integrated with google assistant its the perfect tool. But of course home assistant has tons more uses but still Alex's TV is controled by home assistant and i expect soon Chris will to. So to sum it all up. If you dont have home assistant ...What are you doing with your life its one of those life changing apps if you dont belive me go to episode 7 why we love home assistant
